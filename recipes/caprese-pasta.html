        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"The dynamic trio of fresh basil pesto, mozzarella cheese, and juicy tomato is 
            reunited once again in an American favoriteâ€”pasta salad," says Pepi-Rainbow.
            "This light and fresh salad is great for a lunch, a side dish, or even a snack."

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into strips</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
                Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered,
                stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>Place basil, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic into a blender or food processor;
                cover and chop to a coarse paste. Add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. 
                Continue processing until a soft paste has formed. Set pesto aside.
            </li>
            <li>Combine the cooked pasta, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, mozzarella, and pesto in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
                Cover bowl, refrigerate to chill for 45 minutes, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
