# odin-receipes

Hello and welcome to Johnny's world of recipes. What you will explore throughout this project is a variety of fresh tomato pasta dishes containing 12 different different recipes! This website will allow you to easily navigate through each recipe in the home page with links directing users to each recipe!

This is my first project with learning HTML utilizing the resources from The Odin Project. I am an experienced programmer who is trying to pursue a career in Web Development. Thanks for joining me on my journey.

What I've learned from this project is the basic boilerplating of html files. I've also learned how many elements and tags.

I now know how to link images and content using absolute, relative, and root-relative pathing. I also know how to create ordered and unordered lists. I've also learned how to use linking and pathing to allow users to navigate through a website easily.
